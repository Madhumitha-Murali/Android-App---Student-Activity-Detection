# Android-App---Student-Activity-Detection
Built for Summer Research Project - IIT Guwahati.

Contents of the repository:

1.App which Streams the Necessary Sensor Values Real-Time and stores it in the local storage of the device which periodically gets sent
to the server to apply an ML algorithm on it to classify the attention level of the student based on the sensor values and touch frequencies.

2.Python Code to predict the attention level of the student.


Description:
App Development in Android Studio - and algorithm is streamed to the server (script written in PHP).
The data is recieved at the server and Logistic Regression is used to predict the attention levels of the students.

Was a Research Intern and contibuted towards developing an APP and collecting data, Data Cleaning and Pre-processing, and Prediction using Logistic Regression of the involvement/ attentiveness state of the students in the Blended Learning Environment in the research project 'Predicting Students' Involvement in Blended Learning Environment' which was published in the IEEE International Conference Advanced Learning Technology (ICALT '19) by my mentors-
